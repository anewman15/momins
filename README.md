# Momins

### This is a very basic photo gallery app

## Built With
1. Ruby on Rails v 6.1.6
2. React v 17.0.2
3. Twitter Bootstrap v 5.0

## Deployment

1. Open you Terminal and clone [this repo](https://github.com/anewman15/momins)
2. Navigate to your project directory
3. Run `bundle install` to install gems
4. Run `rails db:create` and `rails db:migrate` to create db tables
5. Run `rails bd:seed` to populate the galleries table. This is a must, as there is no way to create a gallery by the user.
